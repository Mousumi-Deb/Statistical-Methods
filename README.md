This project involves the statistical analysis of the MNIST dataset using R. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the structure and characteristics of the MNIST dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for analysis, including normalization and dimensionality reduction techniques.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying various statistical techniques to gain insights into the dataset.
4. **Modeling**: Building predictive models to classify handwritten digits.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- R programming language
- tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization
- caret: For machine learning modeling and evaluation
- Other relevant libraries for statistical analysis and machine learning tasks


## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the MNIST dataset and explore various statistical techniques for analyzing handwritten digit images. By sharing our findings and code, we hope to contribute to the broader community interested in machine learning and image processing.
