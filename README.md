# Statistical Analysis of the Iris Dataset

This R programming project focuses on performing statistical analysis on the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the species label.


## Features:

- **Data Import:** The code begins by importing the Iris dataset and viewing its structure.

- **Data Summary:** A statistical summary of the dataset is provided, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartile values for each feature.

- **Data Exploration:** Various exploratory data analysis techniques are applied, such as checking for missing values, examining data types, and identifying unique values in categorical columns.

- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, pie charts, and box plots are used to visualize the distributions and relationships between different variables in the dataset.

- **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficients and correlation matrices with heatmaps are computed to analyze the relationships between variables.

- **Regression Analysis:** Linear regression lines are plotted to examine the relationships between pairs of variables. 

- **Z-Score Calculation:** Z-scores are calculated for each variable to standardize the data and identify outliers.

## Required Packages:
- `corrplot`: For visualizing correlation matrices.
- `reshape2`: For reshaping data frames.

## Usage:
1. Install the required packages using `install.packages('corrplot')` and `install.packages('reshape2')`.
2. Import the Iris dataset using `data(iris)` and assign it to the variable `df`.
3. Run each section of the code sequentially to perform the desired statistical analysis and visualization tasks.


## Tools and Libraries Used

- R programming language
- tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization
- caret: For machine learning modeling and evaluation
- Other relevant libraries for statistical analysis and machine learning tasks
